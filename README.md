Been playing keys since the ripe ol' age of 12 and been producing some pretty decent tracks starting from 2020 (I say decent but can't say that for all my stuff ) Rn I am 15, I got a YouTube - CPC Gowda (which you should sub to so you can see more of me ) and not much else to say so… enjoy the music :D" - CPC Gowda | Spotify about me
